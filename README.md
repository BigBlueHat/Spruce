Spruce is a templating system based on the CSS 3 syntax.
========================================================

Spruce is currently in the concepting stages, but our hope is to have a working prototype by mid-year.

The syntax for Spruce is the hardest part. We'd enjoy any and all feedback on where it's headed.

Below is a list of URL's from where we've gleaned much of the inspiration, ideas, and plans for Spruce:
